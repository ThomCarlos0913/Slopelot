**Loading Animation**  
Loading animation is displayed at the start of the application. It is in this phase that the application fetches all the data from the database with the help of a API (Application Programming Interface).

**Dashboard**  
The dashboard is where the data of the sensors are visualized into a bar graph. The upper bar graphs are the soil moisture reading graph while the lower bar graphs are the 3D scatter plots of the accelerometers.
